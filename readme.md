# vestock-monitor

I wanted to learn vlang and figured writing a restock monitor for supreme would be a fun project to build. I've written a few before, but this was really just to learn the language and if it actually functions running restocks at scale then that is probably a bonus.

To build it, ensure you have v installed and run `v -prod main.v`. Then you can open the binary as you would any other. Set the environment variable `WEBHOOK_URL` and watch it go brr

note: webhook sending is not done yet
